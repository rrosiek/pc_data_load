7/22/98   Per Lee Boozer, business official of Texas A&M Research Foundation Baylor College of Dentistry, the F&M rate we used for 3 R29 DE11978-04S1 is based on the rate for Texas A&M Research Foundation.  However, Baylor College of Dentistry has its independent rate.  The result of using different rates for the above award is $79.  The rate for Baylor is confirmed with HHS Cost Allocation Texas location representative Mr. Keaton on 7/22/98.
